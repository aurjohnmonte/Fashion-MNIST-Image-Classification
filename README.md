Questions:
1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?
   - is a collection of 70,000 \(28\times 28\) grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, designed as a modern, more complex replacement for the original MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Created by Zalando Research, it is   widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, particularly for image classification, with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images
    
2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?
   - It is importan for preprocessing step to enhance model performance, speed up training, and ensure stability.

3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.
   - Tensorflow (keras), matplotlib (pyplot), numpy
